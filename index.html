My parents refused to bring me to the exam in another city since did not believe I had a chance. At 5AM I took my old brother's passport so I could buy a ticket and went to the bus stop while my parents were sleeping. After four hours of drive, I was in a city where I have never been before and was already 1 hour late for the exam. Finally, among about seventy students who also took the exams in the city only I was admitted.</p>

Although, I did not know English, I decided to aim to the US colleges. I spent almost every single day of 2012 studying English by myself on an average of 5 hours a day after classes in school. At the beginning of 2013, I was accepted to Northeastern University in Boston.</p>

I phoned about 80 successful alumni from my school, met two billionaires in person and asked them for money, but they did not give. I created and published a website where asked people to donate. About 18,000 people visited my website and donated about $17,000 in two weeks, asking nothing in return. However, that was still not enough and I gave most of the money back.</p>

I bowed to the the first man I saw and asked to live there. I usually woke up at about 4AM, ate once or twice a day, and slept on concreate with thin carpet and wooden pillow. I spent almost two months not reading, writing, and talking with anyone. I meditated most of the time, trying to understand the world and myself. That was the hardest and most profound experience in my life.</p>

                            <p>I am excited about the fact that there are so many greats things in the world can be done. Many of them require a great deal of determination and will. However, the fruits of such effort are well worth it to me.</p> 

                            <p>One of my last ventures was the website <a target="_blank" href="http://samatmikra.ru/"> samatmikra.ru</a>. Half a year ago, I understood how great it would be to help freshmen in my college with the toughest subject in the first year - microeconomics. I knew math, so it was not as difficult for me. For three months I conducted free group classes for those who needed extra help. Every week up to 50 people came to my classes. During that I understood, that having online classes in the web would be great. In those three months I spent on average more that 5 hours a day learning and creating the website, preparing for and recording video classes. Many students spent visited my site daily and overall watched my videos for more than 9000 minutes. After all, it was a great experience: it helped other people in the difficult situation and taught me many valuable skills.</p>

                            <p>In the future, I dream to create or join a great company, where I would be able to devote myself to creation of something of great use to people. </p>

                            <p>I think that the most important thing is doing your best. I would say that putting the maximum effort and losing is better than not doing as well as you could do and winig.</p> 

                            <p>I of my major looses is my application processes to the US colleges. I learned English in a year, was accepted to a university but still was unable to go to study. So I gathered $17,000, and still could not go to study in the US. I went to a university in Russia and finished the first semester with GPA 9.9/10. Nobody I asked knew anyone with such a GPA or higher in the university in the past. I taught this with combination of great test scores would get me to a US college. I applied to 14 colleges: 13 rejected me right away, one added me to a waitlist and then rejected. It turned out that financial aid for international students even smaller than I taught. So now I am applying to the US universities the third time. </p>

                            <p>Sometimes I feel demotivated after trying as hard as I can and still failing. However, the feeling of doing what I have to do overweights it.</p>

                            <p>I believe like the internet as other new technologies is one the greatest tools for people to foster creativity and accelerate change. I think and feel like using the technology as my main tool to create something amazing.</p> 

                            <p>When I was 13 I was excited to find a website for creating websites. Although, it was quite primitive and I did not really code there I spent weeks tweaking around different forums, menus, images, and icons. I talked with my friends a lot about it</p>

                            <p>Now, when I am 19. I am excited about creation of real websites which could help other people. I think that by knowing by myself how to create a technological products I will be able to create a better experience. Since the last year, I code and learn how to code as my main activity. Last half a year I absolutely enjoy programming on average about 7 hours a day. I love Python, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails (and the terminal!). However, I am most thrilled about front end: HTML5, CSS3, LESS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and Mobile Web.</p>

                            <p>I never taught of myself as a future programmer. Because I always taught that I am about doing something for other people - not for computers. However, now I understand that computers are for people. And finally it does not really matter whether I will manage, program, or do something else as long as it creates a great product.</p>

                            <p>When I was 16, I understood that learning is the way to achieve the most ambitious goals. Ever since, this is what I do most of the time and hope to continue learning and grow until the end of my life.
                            </p> 

                            <p>In 2012 from January to May I was staying in school and was reading English Grammar books from beginning to advanced, while in summer I would spent about 8 hours a day. From fall to December I would fear any minute of not learning and would prepare for US college exams all the time after classes and whole holidays
                            </p>

                            <p>In fall and winter 2013 I was aiming to get perfect grades in college and did not go to lectures so I could study more effectively. Every day I would wake up at 4:30AM and study until night. In 2014 and 2015 I became excited about programming. So now I spent on average about 7 hours coding every day. 
                            </p>

                            <p>However, I learning while doing other activities. I care about my health so for the last two years almost every day I jog outside or on a treadmill. While doing that I listen to podcasts, or watch video courses. Also, when I go from one place to another, I listen to an audio book. And when I ride a subway or on a bus I read books. 
                            </p>

                            <p>I love learning different fields and here are some of the topics on which I read a book, listened an audio book, or watched a video course: Human biology, healthy living, sleep science, nanoscience, popular physics and astronomy, Buddhism, mindfulness, psychology, US history, how we learn, learning in games, gamification, startup engineering, the lean startup, effective communication skills, how influence people, Steve Jobs biography, Facebook story.
                            </p>
